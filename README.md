# Twitch Streaming Checklist

Streamers have to do a lot of work just to make sure their streams run smoothly. Keeping track of that can be a daunting and nightmarish task. That is why I created this document wich I reuse for every stream, it helps me remember all the things I need to do so I don't forget anything. It works best if you copy the source code into an editor like [Boost Note](https://boostnote.io/) which will allow you to check the checkboxes off!

## Stream Title

*Make this really stand out by using emoji, using puns, or relate it to what you are doing during you stream. Sometimes putting a question here can help a lot.* 

## Stream Categories

*Put all you normal streaming categories here so that it's easy to remember them all. For example: AMA, LGBTQIA+, backseat gaming, visual ASMR*

## Go Live Notification Message

*This is what is sent in email notifications and smart notifications. Short and sweet works best here!*

## Twitter Post 
*Don't just post that you are live, talk about what you are doing and show that personality! Use a gif, a selfie, or a video to help stand out more.*

## Discord Post
*If possible, tailor these to each community you are in. That way the message resonates with people and they are more likely to click on the link.*

## Conversation Topics
*Keep a list of things you want to talk about or could talk about. That way if it gets quiet you have some fun things to talk about. I usually try to have ten things on my mind so that way if I spend ten minutes talking about each thing, I have an hour and a half of conversation. You can also add to this so you don't lose your train of thought.*

## Notes from Stream
*These are notes about things that I want to keep track of from the stream. If someone does something cool, asks a question I want to follow up, or gives me an idea, I write it here*

#### Additional Notes
If you have channel point redemptions you can also add sections for those either in here or in another similar document. So if for instance you have "Tell a dad joke" as a reward, you can have a list of jokes you haven't told yet listed there so that your stream flows more smoothly.
